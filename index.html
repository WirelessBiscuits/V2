			<p>Zayd Menk is a Zimbabwean interdisciplinary artist primarily working
				within sculpture and installation. Menk’s practice attempts to dissect and
				reveal the imperceptible characteristics of the perpetually proliferating
				technological landscape, its overall omnipresent force, and our social
				cultures attempting to cope with it.</p>
			<p>Central conceptual underpinnings to his work examine a myriad of matters
				concerning the stains of technological progress. The tangents are vast and
				innumerable—questionable ethics in mining, labour, planned obsolescence,
				consumer agency and the right to repair, ecological impacts and
				exploitation digital data.</p>
			<p>Menk uses electronic waste as his primary material, creating landscapes,
				satirical devices that perform arbitrary tasks, and interactive
				installations.</p>
			<p>His Latest Piece “[4.3.2‽&lt;/&gt;_-⨅⨼” is part of the fourth major iteration
				of an evolving installation where he modifies and “fixes” defunct
				electronic waste—adding, removing, and altering various components.</p>
				<p>Menk’s practice has been featured in CNN’s Great Big Story, Designboom,
				Hypebeast, Aesthetica Magazine, My Modern Met, Cochin Herald, and Google’s Instagram page.</p>
